# Highly Efficient Semantic Communication via Semantic-aware Compression


## Overview
Welcome to the repository accompanying our paper "Towards Highly Efficient Semantic Communication via Semantic-aware Compression of Time Series Data". We propose a novel lightweight method to support semantic communication through direct analytics on time series data compressed without decompression via the SHRINK compression. By incorporating semantic quantization and transformations, our method extends SHRINK to align with the principles of semantic communication, enabling task-oriented analytics directly on compressed data.
